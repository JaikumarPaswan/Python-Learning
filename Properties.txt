3. random access (can access i'th item in list)
4. Dynamic size

Tuple
T = (1,2,"k")
1. Imutable
2. Stores different data-types

Dictionary
d = {"key": value, 
     "key2": Value2,
     "key3": [1,2,3],
     1: 2
}
1. Mutable

Sets
S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 5}
1. Ignores repeated value
2. Mutable

#Important
Using while loop, you needs to increment manually like i+=1, j+=1 while comparing two list
Using for loop, you need range to increment
