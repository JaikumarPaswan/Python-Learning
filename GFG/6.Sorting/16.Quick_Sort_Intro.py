#Quick Sort Intro
# 1)Divide and Conquer Algorithm
# 2) Worst case Time: O(n**2)
# 3)Despite O(n**2) worst case, it is considered faster,
# because of the following reasons
#   a) In-Place
#   b) Cache Friendly
#   c)Average case is O(nlogn)
#   d)Tail Recursive
#
#4) Partition is key Function(Naive, Lomuto, Hoare's)
#                             ⬆️Stable   ⬆️ ⬆️Not-Stable but used mostly
#                            but not used
#                            as takes more time
