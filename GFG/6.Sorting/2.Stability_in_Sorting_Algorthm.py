arr = [("Anil", 50), ("ayush", 80), ("piyush", 50), ("Ramesh", 80)]

#sorting above according to their marks

#A stable Algorithm will maintain originaL Order if marks are same
# like "anil" will come first as it occurs first and piyush will come afterward
# 
# A unstable can return ("piyush", 50) first


#Example of Stable Sorts: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort,
#                         Merge Sort,...


#Example of Unstable Sorts: Selection Sort, Quick Sort,
#                           Heap Sort,...
